Printed tool project for Open Source 3D Fabrication.

My assignment for this project was to pick out a tool that I will use multiple times over the two week period of time. I chose a cookie cutter because I love to bake and do it frequently. I found the code online and edited it in Slicr to make it fit my personal preferences. It printed out nicely and was used effectively. I was afraid it would melt when I used it to make pancakes but it in fact worked nicely and didn't melt. If I did this project again I would print it bigger to make it easier to use. I am currently considering printing more for my personal use.
